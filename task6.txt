Que.6  Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear 
identifier improves code readability.

Solution: Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial in JavaScript (and in programming in general) because it 
significantly improves code readability, maintainability, and understandability. Here are some reasons why it's important:

1. Clarity and Understanding: Descriptive variables help you other developers to understand the purpose and usage of the variables 
without having to delve into its implementation.
2. Self-Documenting Code: They provide context and eliminate the need for excessive comments to explain the purpose of a variable.
3. Easier Debugging and Troubleshooting:  When you encounter an issue or a bug in your code, meaningful variable names can help you 
quickly identify the problem area and understand the flow of data.

Code Example: 

// Example without meaningful names
let x = 5;
let y = 7;
let z = x + y;

// Example with meaningful names
let numberOfApples = 5;
let numberOfOranges = 7;
let totalFruitCount = numberOfApples + numberOfOranges;

In the first example, it's not immediately clear what x, y, and z represent. In the second example, the variable names numberOfApples, 
numberOfOranges, and totalFruitCount provide clear information about the data they hold and how they are used. This makes the code much 
more readable and understandable.
