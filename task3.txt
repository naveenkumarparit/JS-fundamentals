Que.3 List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
Solution: In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types. These are basic types of data that represent single values. They are 
immutable (cannot be changed) and have immutable characteristics. Here are the five primitive data types in JavaScript:

1. Number: 
This data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. It can be used for mathematical calculations.

Example:    let myNumber = 42;
            let myFloat = 3.14;

2. String: 
A string is a sequence of characters, which can be letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. Strings are used for representing text.

Example:    let myString = "Hello, World!";

3. Boolean: 
A Boolean represents a true or false value. It is used for logical operations and conditional statements.

Example:    let isTrue = true;
            let isFalse = false;

4. Undefined: 
When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is of type `undefined`. It essentially means that the variable exists, but it has no defined value.

Example:    let myVariable;
            console.log(myVariable); // Outputs: undefined

5. Null: 
`null` represents the absence of any value or object. It is often used to intentionally signify the absence of a value.

Example:    let myNull = null;

Additionally, there is a special type called Symbol, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which is used for creating unique and immutable 
values. Symbols are typically used as object property keys to avoid naming conflicts.
