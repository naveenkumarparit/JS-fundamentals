Que.4 What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?

Solution: Declaring variables in JavaScript serves the purpose of reserving memory space to store data that can be used and manipulated 
in a program. Variables allow you to store values and reference them by a specific name, making it easier to work with data in your 
code.  They play a fundamental role in performing calculations, storing user input, managing program state, and facilitating the flow of 
data within the application. By declaring variables, developers can create organized and efficient code, enhancing the readability, 
maintainability, and overall functionality of their JavaScript programs.

Syntax:
    let variableName = value;

Declaration of variable using `let` keyword:    let myName = "Naveen Kumar Parit";
