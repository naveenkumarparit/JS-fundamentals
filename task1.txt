Que.1 Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

Solution: JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behaviour to 
websites. It was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation in the mid-1990s.

Javascript is an essential component of modern web development, along with HTML and CSS. It can manipulate the DOM (Document Object 
Model), handle events, communicate with servers (using technologies like AJAX), and much more.

Here are some key roles of JavaScript in web development:
1. Adding Interactivity: JavaScript allows you to create interactive elements on a wee page. This includes things like form validation, 
image sliders, pop-up dialogs, and more.

2. Dynamic content: Javascript can be used to dynamically update and change the content of a web page without requiring a full page 
reload. This creates a smoother and more engaging user experience.

3. Manipulating the DOM: Javascript can manipulate the Document Object Model, which is the representation of a web page's structure in 
the browser memory. This enables developers to add, remove, or modify elements on a web page dynamically.

4. Event Handling: Javascript can respond to user interactions like clicks, keystrokes, and mouse movements. This allows for the creation
of interactive interfaces.

5. Communicating with Servers: JavaScript can make HTTP requests to servers, allowing it to fetch or send data without needing to reload 
the entire page. This is often done using techniques like AJAX.

6. Creating Web Applications: JavaScript is the foundation of many modern web applications and frameworks. Libraries like React, Vue, and 
Angular as well as frameworks like Node.js, allow developers to build complex applications entirely using JavaScript.

7. Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a reliable choice for web development.
